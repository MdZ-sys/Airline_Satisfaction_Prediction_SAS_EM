# Airline_Satisfaction_Prediction_SAS_EM
To build predictive models for customer satisfaction in the airline industry using SAS Enterprise Miner

BUSINESS GOALS
Customers who are not happy or who are not engaged result in fewer passengers and decreased revenue. A consumer should always have a good experience when they travel. On-time flights, good in-flight entertainment, more (and better) refreshments, and more leg room are some of the apparent elements that may enhance a positive experience and build loyalty.
An airline company's overall objectives for customer satisfaction may be separated into two categories: To draw both leisure and business travelers in order to boost recurring business, and to make sure that customers always receive the best possible service from the airline. Factors affecting customer satisfaction can include baggage theft, delayed flights, uncomfortable seats, hidden charges, poor customer service and a many more such issues. 
To combat this, many airlines turn to the use of surveys. To ascertain how typical each customer's ideas and experiences are, surveys are a useful analytical tool. When done correctly, surveys provide accurate information on the attitudes and behaviors of consumers that may be used to guide important business decisions.

METHODOLOGY
This project is built around the process paradigm known as the CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM). It entails six successive steps.
 
STEP 1 – Business Understanding
	Understanding the project's goals and needs is the main emphasis of the business understanding step. As mentioned previously this project focuses on the satisfaction of customers in the airline industry and how to develop a model that can be used to predict the same. The deliverables of this project would help an airline business to make better decision based on data to further its profitability by better serving its customers. 
STEP 2 – Data Understanding
	This stage focuses on locating, obtaining, and analysing data sets that may help in accomplishing project goals in addition to improving the foundation of business understanding. As previously stated, this project will use a public dataset that consists of 103904 record. Tebleau will be used for exploring and understanding the patterns present in the dataset. This project will attempt to present different types of analysis for better data understanding. 
STEP 3 – Data Preparation 
	This steps prepares the data for final model building. The data considered for this project is large in size. But fortunately, this dataset is mostly clean. This step will include actions such as outlier/skewness treatment and imputation of missing data. Variables with low worth will also be dropped during this step. The link for the publicly available datset already consists of train-test split for model building and therfore, data splitting will not incorporated for this project however, the data will be split for training and validation of the machine learning models. 
STEP 4 – Modeling 
	This stage focuses on creating multiple models using a variety of modeling methodologies. This project will attempt to create a few different models that can be used for predicting customer satisfaction, namely, Decesion Tree, Regression, HP models (Tree and Regression) and different Neural Nets for comparison. These models will be created using the SAS Enterprise Miner. The models will then be assesed to choose the best two models which will be explained extensively.  
STEP 5 – Evaluation
	The assessment step examines which model best matches the business and what to do next in more detail. Questions such as – Does the model meet the business success criteria? Were all steps carried out correctly? Will be answered summarized to make any necessary corrections. This step determines whether to proceed toward deployment, iterate further, or initiate revised objectives. 
STEP 6 – Deployment 
	The project objectives will be complete at this stage and the deliverables can be given to an organization in the airline industry for detrmining their marketing strategies and implementing the findings of this project in a real world scenario. This step is beyond the scope of this project.
